DIGITAL INTEGRATED CIRCUITS PROJECT
Design of  Efficient 4x4  Enhanced Pipeline multiplier Based with Various Optimization Techniques




Teams of 3 students undertake a large circuit design problem, going from specification to implementation while optimizing for speed, area, and/or power. Group collaboration and engineering design. See attached papers for Design of Power Efficient 4x4 Multiplier Based On Various Power Optimizing Techniques. As a reference. The last day for presentation is Sep 7th . 

Turn it in Report with similarity less than 20% Is required on Turnitin .  
Best report can be published will get 40/40 in the project instead of the regular mark. This includes detail instruction on how to preduce the design as appendix to the paper and video 

GRADES: Grading is based upon the following factors
Presentation summary as presenting this into a conference and Final project report 
Technical competency in pursuing project goals
Proficiency in collaboration, as measured by overall project integration and success.
